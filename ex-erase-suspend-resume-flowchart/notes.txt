1.) The Erase Suspend & Resume flowchart is given on pg-44 of the datasheet.

Insert image of the flowchart

Notes on the design:
1.) Following the book, the status register address is set to 0x00

2.) The device specific register addresses and status flags are defined in m28w160ect.h

3.) The "any_address" used in write and read operations mentioned in the flowchart is defined by the variable randomAddr = 0x01

4.) Flash_Create() and Flash_Destroy() functions are dummy functions created to maintain consistency

In summary, the test list and design is very similar to the test list created for write operation explained in chapter 10. I couldn't think of any additional tests for this exercise.

# tdd-embedded-c-ex
This repository consists of my solutions to the exercises in the book, [Test Driven Development for Embedded C by James W. Grenning](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435662X)

Becasue the exercises were either unique or additional tests were added to previous versions I did not create one makefile that builds and executes all exercises together. The instructions to build and execute each exercise are mentioned in the corresponding readme file.

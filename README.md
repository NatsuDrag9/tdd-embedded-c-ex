# tdd-embedded-c-ex
This repository consists of my solutions to the exercises in the book, Test Driven Development for Embedded C by James W. Grenning

As the exercises were either entirely unique and had no overlap or, additional tests were added to previous versions. Thus I did not create one makefile that builds and executes all exercises together. The instructions to build and execute exercise are mentioned in the corresponding readme file.

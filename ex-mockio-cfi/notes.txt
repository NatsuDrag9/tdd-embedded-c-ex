1.) According to table 3 of the datasheet, the read CFI Query (RCFI) command performs two bus operations - one write followed by one read. Table 3 does not specify the write address for the first write operation, so I decided to proceed with 0x00. The read operation 

2.) RCFI may also perform multiple reads but I decided to proceed with one read.

3.) Skipping this questions because of the following questions:
(a) What is the meaning of query in read operation in table 3? And how is it different from CFI Address?
My understanding of read operation in table 3: Query refers to the various sub-sections in table 25 and the CFI Address corresponds to the offset within each sub-section from where data is retrieved.
(b) How to use MOCKIO to test a structure returned from RCFI command?
(c) Chaging the return type of IO_Read() from ioData to (say) a structure of CFI would affect the MOCKIO library. How to resolve this issue?

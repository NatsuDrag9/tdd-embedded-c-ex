Question
Test-drive an alarm clock service that keeps a list of time call-
backs. In production, the timer interrupt will ping the time service
every 100 milliseconds. When a scheduled action is ready to run,
call the callback function.

1.) Notes on the design

Show the UML diagram

(a) Some of the tests of ACS are directly taken from the light scheduler because their architecture and functionalities are similar. 

(b) When the date and time is right, the alarms are triggered by default and another callback function expecting the following two options as parameters is called:
(i) Turn off
(ii) Snooze`

(c) The snooze option is by default set to 5 min and cannot be changed.

(d) The maximum nmber of alarms that can be created is 32 (set the upper limit myself)

(e) It is given that the timer interrupt of the underlying RTOS pings every 100 ms

The test list is shown below

1.) It is recommended to provide absolute paths to the variables declared in CppUTest's MakefileWorker.To dynamically generate absolute paths within test makefile, follow the instructions by Matheus Marques in https://matheusmbar.com/bugfree-robot/2019/04/05/makefile-first-test.html 

2.) Shawn Hymel's Intro to CI/CD part 3 helped me create my own CI workflow using github actions and structure my project directory accordingly. I also created my own test makefile that defines the variables MakefileWorker.mk

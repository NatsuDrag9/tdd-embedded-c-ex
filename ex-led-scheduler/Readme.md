This is an exercise on Test Driven Development for embedded systems. The cpputest framework from [cpputest-starter-project](https://github.com/jwgrenning/cpputest-starter-project) is used to test the Led scheduler example in chapter 8 of the book.

The cpputest is compiled with Autotools according to the instructions mentioned in the [readme](https://github.com/jwgrenning/cpputest-starter-project/blob/master/readme/cpputest-starter-kit-readme.pdf) file of [cpputest-starter-project](https://github.com/jwgrenning/cpputest-starter-project) by James W. Grenning.

Note - Remember to set the path of the environment variable CPPUTEST_HOME for successful compilation

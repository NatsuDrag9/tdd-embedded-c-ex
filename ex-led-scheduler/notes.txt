Notes on tests:

1.) I could not resolve test failure pertaining to RemoveRecyclesScheduleSlot

2.) Completed all the test cases


Notes on bulding the project and build automation using Github Actions
1.) Made the project modular
After removing cpputest and cpputest-starter-project from this project directory even for the build process using autotools, I changed the folder structure with the unit tests and test makefile in ex-unit-tests/. 

The makefile in the project's root directory controls the execution of the project (make, make test, make clean, make clean_test -- refer readme file).

2.) Build automation and CI using Github Actions
I created a unit_tests_led_scheduler.yml which was taken from Shawn Hymel's "Intro to CI/CD Part 3" (https://youtu.be/lZWFmEhIhpY?t=2681).
The dockerfile was modified to copy unit tests and test makefile from ex-unit-tests/.

3.) Time Consuming
It took me three days to understand and implement the build automation using Github Actions in a presentable manner. It was important to make the repository and the project directory presentable because:
(i) If asked, I have to talk about this process in the interview
(ii) I could not visualize the final presentable output so I was experimenting with different possibilites (like creating multiple branches, watching videos on using Jenkins for embedded systems) until I found an elegant one (thanks to Shawn)
